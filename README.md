## Requirements

- [NodeJS 18+](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (or equivalent)

If you'd like to use the included Dockerfile then [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is required as well:

## Getting Started

Getting started is a simple as cloning the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/warpbuilds/ui-core.git
```

Changing into the new directory

```
cd ui-core
```

Installing dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

And running the setup script (initializes git repository and husky)

```
pnpm run setup
```

**Note**: This repo comes with a commit-msg hook to run [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) on the git message. Commitlint will ensure the commit message follows the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

## Testing

Unit testing is handled by React Testing Library and Vitest 

If you'd like to run all tests, Unit and E2E alike, execute the following command:

```
pnpm run test
```

### Unit Testing

When running unit test scripts, it is assumed that unit tests will be colocated with the source files. Take a look at the placeholder README file in `src/components` for [an example](src/components/README.md).

If you'd like to execute unit tests specifically, the below command will execute vitest:

```
pnpm run test:unit
```

If instead you are interested in coverage reporting, run:

```
pnpm run test:unit:coverage
```

All unit tests run in watch mode by default. If you'd like to disable watch mode, change the package.json test scripts with the following

before:

```
"scripts": {
  	"test:unit": "vitest src/",
	"test:unit:coverage": "vitest --coverage src/"
}
```

After:

```
"scripts": {
  	"test:unit": "vitest run src/",
	"test:unit:coverage": "vitest run --coverage src/"
}
```

### Conventions to be followed:

* All image filenames should be in Kebab case.
* Images from figma must be exported as svg.
* Routes should be defined in Kebab case.
* React components should be in Pascal case.
* Try to limit files to max 500 LOC. Split into modules.
* Query keys should have the same name as the corresponding APIs and any identifiers if required. Example:
  ```js
  ["getUsers", orgId]
  ```
